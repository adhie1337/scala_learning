This directory contains a Rational class as explained in Chapter 5 - Functional Objects of the book. The Rational.scala file contains the class and the rational_examples.scala file contains usage and examples of the class. It is used as a "test" of the implementation. The cause of this is that I didn't learn how to write unit tests when I was reading this chapter.
