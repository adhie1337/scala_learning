# Scala learning

This repository contains code that I write while learning the scala programming language.

## Getting Started

### Directory structure

The project root contains directories that focus on one source of learning. Sources will be books, papers or online courses. These directories contain subdirectories that represent categories. The logical structure of the given source. Examples of these categories contain chapters of a book. More examples are weeks, topics or assignments of an online course. Look for a README.md in each directory of the project for information about the scope.

Each directory starts with a numeric prefix to support ordering where helpful.

### Prerequisites

I use the following tools and frameworks for coding:

* java version 11.0.2 2019-01-15 LTS
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS)
* Scala code runner version 2.12.8 -- Copyright 2002-2018, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.
